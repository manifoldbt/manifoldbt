"""The lite sweep path must agree with `run()` on intraday bars.

`run_sweep_lite` is a separate transcription of the simulation, kept for speed
(roughly ten times the throughput of the full sweep). Its metrics are computed
from a *daily* equity curve, and that curve's first point is the equity at the
CLOSE of day one. Taking it as the growth base silently drops day one's profit
and loss from every metric measured against it, which shipped as an 8% error on
`total_return` for a fourteen-day intraday backtest.

The bug was invisible on daily bars: with a 60-period indicator the warmup
covers sixty days, so the close of day one still equals the initial capital and
the base is right by accident. It only appears when trading starts on day one,
which on 1-minute bars is the normal case. Hence this test runs intraday.

All fourteen metrics must be identical. `ulcer_index` used to be the exception:
it is accumulated over whichever curve it is handed, so the lite and GPU sweeps
measured it on daily points while `run()` measured it bar by bar, and the same
backtest carried two different values depending on the entry point. It now
follows the daily series on every path, like the Sharpe, Sortino and volatility
beside it, and like the published definition of the Ulcer Index. `max_drawdown`
deliberately stays full-resolution: a drawdown that opens and recovers inside a
day is a real one and belongs in the maximum.
