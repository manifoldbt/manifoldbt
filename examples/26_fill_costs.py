"""Fills - the same signal, filled four ways.

A backtest's return is half signal, half fill. This runs one ordinary strategy
(buy the dip in an uptrend, leave on a bracket) and changes nothing but how the
entry is filled, so the cost of each execution choice is visible side by side:

    market          take the close, cross the book, pay taker + slippage
    limit -25bps    rest below the market, pay maker, and sometimes miss
    limit -75bps    rest deeper: a better price, filled far less often
    stop +25bps     chase the breakout, pay taker, and gap through on a jump

Then two things worth knowing about a resting order, once you use one:

  * **Unfilled is a result.** A limit that never trades is not a neutral
    outcome, it is a trade you did not take. The engine says how many expired.
  * **Touched is not traded.** When a bar's low stops exactly on your bid, the
    queue ahead of you may have absorbed everything. `fill_fragility` counts
    those fills, and `passive_fill="traverse"` prices them out.

Demonstrates:
  - market, limit and stop entries priced from the same signal
  - maker versus taker: fees paid, slippage paid, fill rate
  - `result.fill_fragility` and the `passive_fill` convention
  - why a resting order needs `signal_delay >= 1`
