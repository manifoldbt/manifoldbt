## Quick Start

```python
import manifoldbt as mbt
from manifoldbt.indicators import close, ema
from manifoldbt.helpers import time_range, Slippage, Interval

# -- Indicators
fast = ema(close, 12)
slow = ema(close, 50)

# -- Strategy
strategy = (
    mbt.Strategy.create("ema_cross")
    .signal("fast", fast)
    .signal("slow", slow)
    .size(mbt.when(fast > slow, 0.5, 0.0))
    .stop_loss(pct=3.0)
)

# -- Config
start, end = time_range("2022-01-01", "2025-01-01")
config = mbt.BacktestConfig(
    universe=[1],
    time_range_start=start,
    time_range_end=end,
    bar_interval=Interval.hours(12),
    initial_capital=10_000,
    fees=mbt.FeeConfig.binance_perps(),
    slippage=Slippage.fixed_bps(2),
    warmup_bars=60,
)

# -- Run
store = mbt.DataStore(data_root="data", metadata_db="metadata/metadata.sqlite")
result = mbt.run(strategy, config, store)
print(result.summary())
```

---

## Indicators

All indicators are available from `manifoldbt.indicators`. They return `Expr` objects that compose into the expression graph — no data is touched at definition time.

```python
from manifoldbt.indicators import (
    close, open, high, low, volume,  # price columns
    ema, sma, dema, tema, wma, hma, kama,  # moving averages
    rsi, roc, momentum, macd,  # momentum
    bollinger_bands, atr, natr, keltner_channels,  # volatility
    stoch_k, williams_r, cci, adx,  # oscillators
    obv, vwap, mfi,  # volume
    kalman, garch,  # filters
)
```

### Usage

```python
fast = ema(close, 12)          # EMA with span 12
slow = sma(close, 50)          # SMA with window 50
strength = rsi(close, 14)      # RSI with period 14
upper, mid, lower = bollinger_bands(close, period=20, num_std=2.0)
```

### Method chaining

Column expressions (`close`, `high`, etc.) support method chaining:

```python
zscore = close.zscore(60)           # rolling z-score
slope = close.linreg_slope(20)      # linear regression slope
smoothed = close.ewm_mean(12)       # EMA
lagged = close.lag(5)               # 5-bar lag
ret = close.pct_change(1)           # 1-bar return
```

---

### Windows in time

A window is normally a **bar count**: `close.rolling_mean(30)` averages the last
thirty rows. On a grid with holes that is not what it looks like. On an irregular
grid (thin sessions, halted hours, sub-minute bars that print only when
something traded), thirty bars can span thirty seconds on a busy minute and
four minutes on a quiet one -- the same expression measures a different thing
depending on the flow.

Pass an `Interval` instead of an integer and the window is read on the
timestamps:

```python
from manifoldbt.helpers import Interval

mid = close.rolling_mean(Interval.seconds(30))    # 30 SECONDS, not 30 bars
vol = close.rolling_std(Interval.minutes(5))
lo, hi = close.rolling_min(Interval.seconds(10)), close.rolling_max(Interval.seconds(10))
z = close.zscore(Interval.seconds(30))
```

**Semantics.** The window is `(t - d, t]`: closed on the right, open on the
left, the same convention as `pandas.rolling("30s")`. A row exactly `d` old is
already out. While the series holds less than `d` of history -- that is, while
`t - t_first < d` -- the answer would come from a truncated window, so the output
is NaN, exactly as a bar-count window is NaN over its first `window - 1` rows.
Past that point the values equal `pandas.rolling("30s")` row for row.

A NaN anywhere in the window yields NaN for `rolling_mean`, `rolling_sum`,
`rolling_std`, `zscore` and the pair statistics, while `rolling_min` and
`rolling_max` simply ignore the NaN rows. That is the same rule as the
bar-count versions, so switching a window from bars to seconds changes the
window and nothing else. Timestamps must be non-decreasing; they are on every
grid the engine builds.

**Where a duration is accepted.**

| Operator | Bar count | Duration |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| `rolling_mean`, `rolling_sum`, `rolling_std`, `rolling_min`, `rolling_max` | yes | yes |
| `zscore`, `rolling_var` | yes | yes |
| `rolling_corr`, `rolling_cov`, `rolling_beta` | yes | yes |
| `count_over` | yes | yes |
| `ewm_mean` | `span=` | `halflife=` |
| everything else (`rsi`, `atr`, `rolling_median`, `lag`, pivots, ...) | yes | **refused by name** |

An operator with no time-based implementation refuses a duration and says so,
rather than reading it as a bar count.

**`ewm_mean(halflife=...)`.** `ewm_mean(span=20)` counts bars and is the plain
recurrence. `ewm_mean(halflife=Interval.seconds(2))` decays with the time
elapsed between two rows: a row `dt` old weighs `0.5 ** (dt / halflife)`. It
matches `pandas.ewm(halflife="2s", times=...).mean()`, the weighted-average
form, which is the only one pandas offers on an irregular axis. Having no
window it has no warmup either -- the value exists from the first row, like the
span form.

**Two operators that only exist in time.**

```python
from manifoldbt import indicators as ind

quiet_for = ind.time_since(volume > 1000)        # SECONDS since it was last true
printed   = ind.count_over(Interval.seconds(30)) # bars the last 30 s actually printed
```

`time_since(cond)` is the twin of `bars_since(cond)`: seconds since the last row
where the condition was true, `0.0` on a true row, NaN until it first is.
`count_over(Interval.seconds(30))` -- a duration with no condition -- counts the
**rows** in the window, which is how a strategy reads how gappy its own grid is.
`count_over(cond, Interval.seconds(30))` still counts the true ones.

**Durations are literal.** `param()` sweeps a bar count, not a duration:
`rolling_mean(param("w"))` works, a swept duration does not exist yet. A sweep
axis in seconds is a later step.

**Not on GPU.** A duration window evicts on a bound that moves with the
timestamps, where every GPU kernel here indexes by a constant row offset. A
sweep whose expressions carry one is refused by name (`gpu-sweep-unsupported`)
and has to run with `device="cpu"`; it is not silently downgraded, because that
would return numbers computed over a different window from the CPU's.

## Signals & Sizing

### Strategy builder

```python
strategy = (
    mbt.Strategy.create("my_strategy")
    .signal("fast", fast)           # named signal
    .signal("slow", slow)           # signals form a DAG
    .size(signal_expr)              # position sizing expression
    .describe("Strategy description")
)
```

### `mbt.when()` — conditional logic

```python
# Long when fast > slow, flat otherwise
signal = mbt.when(fast > slow, 0.5, 0.0)

# Nested: long / short / flat
signal = mbt.when(fast > slow, 0.25,
         mbt.when(fast < slow, -0.25, 0.0))

# Hold current position (omit 3rd arg or use NaN)
signal = mbt.when(rsi(close, 14) < 30, 1.0)  # buy oversold, hold otherwise
```

### `mbt.hold()` holds the POSITION, not the value

`mbt.hold()` is NaN, and the engine reads NaN at the top of the position
expression as *leave the position where it is*. It holds the position the
simulator currently carries, not the last value of the expression around it.
Two consequences worth knowing before you write a regime filter:

- after a stop-loss or take-profit fired, `hold()` keeps the position **flat**.
  It does not replay the last signal value and buy back in.
- under a filter, `hold()` holds whatever the filter last wrote:

```python
state = mbt.when(imb >= thr, 1.0,
        mbt.when(imb <= -thr, -1.0, mbt.hold()))
pos   = mbt.when(regime_open, state, 0.0)      # reads as a trap
```

While the filter is closed the target is `0.0`, so the position goes flat. When
it reopens on a bar where `state` falls through to `hold()`, the engine holds
that flat position: exposure only returns on the **next** threshold crossing.
Measured on a flow strategy, a filter open 55% of the time left 0.7% exposure.
Nothing warns, and routing `state` through a named `.signal()` changes nothing.

Both behaviours are legitimate. Pick the one you meant:

| Intent | Write |
|--------|-------|
| Exit while the regime is hostile, re-enter only on a **new** signal | keep `hold()` inside the `when`: `mbt.when(regime_open, <...hold()...>, 0.0)` |
| Persistent state that you **mask** | build the state as a series, then mask it (below) |

```python
# .ffill() carries the last non-NaN value of the SERIES. The omitted false
# branch of when() is already NaN, so this is the whole idiom:
state = mbt.when(imb >= thr, 1.0,
        mbt.when(imb <= -thr, -1.0)).ffill()
pos   = mbt.when(regime_open, state, 0.0)      # back on the bar the filter reopens
```

Masking a `ffill` state does not destroy it. `cond.value_when(value)` writes the
same series with an explicit trigger; with no filter and nothing else moving the
position, the three spellings give the same trades.

### Arithmetic on expressions

```python
trend = fast - slow
spread = close / (pair_close + mbt.lit(1e-12))   # mbt.lit() for constants in arithmetic
signal = -spread_z * mbt.lit(0.05)                # negation + scaling
```

> **Note:** `mbt.lit()` is needed for constants in arithmetic (`close + mbt.lit(1e-12)`). Numbers auto-coerce inside `mbt.when()`.

### Sizing modes

| Mode                         | Meaning                                              |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `FractionOfEquity` (default) | `1.0` = allocate 100% of current equity              |
| `FractionOfInitialCapital`   | `1.0` = allocate 100% of initial capital (no compounding) |
| `Units`                      | `1.0` = hold exactly 1 unit (share/contract/coin)    |

```python
execution=mbt.ExecutionConfig(position_sizing_mode="FractionOfInitialCapital")
```

### Special values

| Value  | Behavior                                |
|--------|-----------------------------------------|
| `1.0`  | Full long position                      |
| `0.0`  | Flat (close position)                   |
| `-0.5` | Short 50% (requires `allow_short=True`) |
| `NaN`  | Hold the current POSITION unchanged (`mbt.hold()`) |

## Parameters & Sweeps

Use `mbt.param()` to define sweepable parameters in indicator periods:

```python
fast = ema(close, mbt.param("fast", default=12))
slow = ema(close, mbt.param("slow", default=50))

strategy = (
    mbt.Strategy.create("ema_cross")
    .signal("fast", fast)
    .signal("slow", slow)
    .size(mbt.when(fast > slow, 0.25, -0.25))
)
```

Parameters are auto-collected from expressions — no `.param()` needed on the Strategy.

### Sweep execution

```python
# Full sweep (returns Result per combo)
sweep = mbt.run_sweep(strategy, {"fast": [5, 12, 20], "slow": [50, 100]}, config, store)
best = sweep.best("sharpe")

# Lite sweep (metrics only, much faster for large grids)
batch = mbt.run_sweep_lite(strategy, {"fast": range(5, 100), "slow": range(10, 500)}, config, store)
```

Grids this size need Pro; Community is capped, and the engine tells you where
you stand when you hit it. Single `bt.run()` calls are never gated.

`run_sweep_lite` is optimized for large parameter grids (100k+ combos):
- Cartesian product expansion in Rust (no Python loop)
- Signals and position sizing compiled as one graph, so what they share is
  computed once
- Shared indicator cache (EMA(12) computed once, reused across combos)
- Bars and higher-timeframe columns resampled once per sweep, not per combo
- Metrics only — no Arrow output, and signals nothing reads are never
  materialised

Add `device="cuda"` on a machine with an NVIDIA GPU and a CUDA build. It pays
off on large grids, where it is typically an order of magnitude faster;
`device="auto"` (the default) picks between CPU and GPU for you, since the GPU
loses on small ones. Results are identical either way. A strategy the GPU
cannot take falls back to the CPU and says which setting caused it.

---

## Backtest Configuration

```python
config = mbt.BacktestConfig(
    universe=[1, 2],                       # symbol IDs
    time_range_start=start,
    time_range_end=end,
    bar_interval=Interval.hours(4),        # signal evaluation resolution
    initial_capital=10_000,
    execution=mbt.ExecutionConfig(...),
    fees=mbt.FeeConfig.binance_perps(),
    slippage=Slippage.fixed_bps(2),
    warmup_bars=60,                        # bars to skip for indicator warmup
    accuracy=False,                        # True = simulate on 1-min bars
)
```

### Bar intervals

```python
Interval.seconds(1)    # 1-second (Pro)
Interval.minutes(1)    # 1-min
Interval.minutes(15)   # 15-min
Interval.hours(1)      # 1-hour
Interval.hours(4)      # 4-hour
Interval.hours(12)     # 12-hour
Interval.days(1)       # daily
```

Anything below one minute is a Pro step; Community simulates at one minute at
the finest. `bar_interval` is one minute when left out.

### Accuracy mode

```python
config = mbt.BacktestConfig(
    bar_interval=Interval.hours(4),   # signals on 4h
    accuracy=True,                    # simulation on 1-min bars
    ...
)
```

When `accuracy=True`, the engine loads `bars_1m` and runs in hybrid mode: signals evaluated on `bar_interval`, simulation tick-by-tick on 1-min bars. Use for precise SL/TP fill detection. ~60x slower than normal mode.

---

## Execution Model

```python
mbt.ExecutionConfig(
    signal_delay=0,                    # bars between signal and execution
    execution_price="AtClose",         # AtClose, AtOpen, AtVwap, MidPrice,
                                       # or ExecutionPrice.custom(name)
    max_position_pct=0.5,              # max position as fraction of equity
    allow_short=True,                  # allow short positions
    allow_fractional=True,             # allow fractional units
    position_sizing_mode="FractionOfEquity",
    pyramiding=False,                  # True = signal is delta, not target
)
```

### Filling at a computed level

`ExecutionPrice.custom(name)` accepts a bar column (`"vwap"`, ...) **or the
name of any signal the strategy defines**, so a market fill can land on a level
the DSL computes instead of the bar's close. The canonical use is a band
strategy on native fine bars: the entry level is known before the bar starts,
and the touch bar itself proves the level traded (it sits between open and
high), yet a close fill would be systematically on the wrong side of it.

```python
from manifoldbt.indicators import close, high, low, open, sma
sma_20 = sma(close, 20)
band_up, band_dn = sma_20 * 1.012, sma_20 * 0.992
exec_level = mbt.when(high >= band_up,
                      mbt.when(open >= band_up, open, band_up),   # gapped through
             mbt.when(low <= band_dn,
                      mbt.when(open <= band_dn, open, band_dn),
             close))
strategy = strategy.signal("exec_level", exec_level)
config.execution.execution_price = mbt.ExecutionPrice.custom("exec_level")
```

One series covers entry AND exit fills. The rules that keep it honest:

- the series is read at the order's **signal row**, never ahead of it;
- a fill outside the execution bar's `[low, high]` range draws a warning;
- a row with no value (warm-up) falls back to the close, with a warning;
- a name that is neither a column nor a signal is rejected before the run;
- a bar column always wins over a same-named signal (warned about).

**A custom execution price keeps the fast kernel, and the GPU.** Sweeping one is
as fast as sweeping a plain `AtClose` strategy, and `device="cuda"` accepts it:
the level is evaluated in the kernel beside the position sizing, so correct
fills no longer cost throughput. Results are identical on both devices.

Two conditions, and the sweep says so when either fails: the name must resolve
to a **signal** rather than a bar column (a column is read per execution row, a
different rule), and the strategy must have no exit orders, whose entry-bar
re-check needs the general loop. `run()` is unaffected either way.

### Filling at the open

`execution_price="AtOpen"` fills at the **open of the execution bar** -- the
signal row shifted by `signal_delay`. With `signal_delay=1` that is the honest
intraday convention: the bar closes, the signal is computed, and the order
reaches the market at the next bar's opening print. Sizing, equity and the
duplicate-signal check keep reading the execution bar's close, exactly as under
`AtClose`; only the fill price moves.

**AtOpen keeps the fast kernel, and the GPU.** Sweeping it costs the same as
sweeping `AtClose` (measured within 5% on a one-second store), and
`device="cuda"` accepts it with no fallback. Results are identical on both
devices, to the bit.

Two combinations stay on the general loop, and the sweep names them: an
AtOpen fill combined with **exit orders** (a fill that lands mid-bar can be
stopped out by the rest of that same bar, which the fast kernel does not
replay), and a **multi-asset** universe. `run()` is unaffected either way.

### Signal delay

| Value | Behavior                                                        |
|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `0`   | **Default.** Fill at the close of the signal bar                |
| `1`   | Fill on the next bar (t+1)                                      |
| `2+`  | Fill N bars after the signal                                    |

`0` models a decision taken on the bar's own close and filled at that close, the
market-on-close convention, and it is what vectorbt's `from_signals` does. It is
the right default for coarse bars, where one bar of delay would mean pricing a
full day of latency into a decision that in reality reaches the market in
seconds.

Raise it when a bar is short enough that one bar is a plausible
decision-to-fill latency: on 1s or sub-second bars, `signal_delay=1` *is* the
realistic setting, and `0` assumes an infinitely fast round trip. The engine
does not infer this from `bar_interval`, so it is on you to set it.

## Fee & Slippage Models

### Fees

```python
mbt.FeeConfig.binance_perps()    # maker=2bps, taker=5bps, funding
mbt.FeeConfig.binance_spot()     # maker=10bps, taker=10bps
mbt.FeeConfig.zero()             # no fees (for development)

# Custom
mbt.FeeConfig(
    maker_fee_bps=2.0,
    taker_fee_bps=5.0,
    funding_rate_column="funding_rate",
    default_fill_type="Taker",
)
```

### Slippage

```python
Slippage.fixed_bps(2)     # 2 bps per trade (simplest)
Slippage.volume_impact(0.1, exponent=0.5)   # qty/volume model
Slippage.spread_based(0.5)                  # spread-based
```

---

## Orders (SL/TP/Trailing)

Each of the three takes `side="both"` (default), `"long"` or `"short"`: an
order armed on one side leaves the other bare, so a strategy that trades
both directions can stop its shorts and let its longs run. A distance swept
from a grid (`stop_loss` as a sweep parameter) keeps the side the strategy
set.

```python
strategy = (
    mbt.Strategy.create("my_strat")
    .signal(...)
    .size(...)
    .stop_loss(pct=3.0, side="short")   # 3% stop-loss, on the shorts only
    .take_profit(pct=5.0)               # 5% take-profit, both sides
    .trailing_stop(pct=2.0)             # 2% trailing stop, both sides
)
```

Orders travel with the strategy, so they apply wherever it runs: `run`,
`run_batch`, `run_sweep` and `run_portfolio`.

In a portfolio each leg is an independent run on `initial_capital * weight`
and the portfolio equity is the sum of the legs. Two consequences:
`max_position_pct` clamps on the leg's equity, not the portfolio's, and with
the default `FractionOfEquity` sizing each leg compounds on its own. Set
`position_sizing_mode="FractionOfInitialCapital"` when the portfolio must
equal the sum of its legs run separately.

### What each order accepts

| order | `pct` | `offset_bps` | `price` | `signal` | options |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `limit_entry`, `stop_entry`, `market_if_touched` | no | yes | yes | yes | `time_in_force`, `size_at_fill_price` |
| `stop_limit_entry` | no | no | `stop`, `limit` | `stop_signal`, `limit_signal` | same |
| `stop_loss`, `take_profit` | yes | no | no | yes | `side` |
| `trailing_stop` | yes | no | no | yes | `use_high`, `side` |

### A distance that changes with the market

`pct=2.0` is one number for the whole run. `signal="name"` reads the distance
from a series the strategy computes, so a stop can be two ATR wide on a quiet
day and twice that on a violent one. The series holds a **percentage of the
price**, the same unit `pct` uses, and it is exclusive of `pct`.

```python
from manifoldbt.indicators import atr, close

# 2 ATR, expressed as a percentage of the price
stop_dist = mbt.lit(2.0) * atr(14) / close * mbt.lit(100.0)

strategy = (
    mbt.Strategy.create("atr_stop")
    .signal("stop_dist", stop_dist)      # named, so the order can reference it
    .size(...)
    .stop_loss(signal="stop_dist")
)
```

Three rules make that a well-defined order rather than a moving target:

**The distance is read on the signal bar.** The bar whose signal decided the
entry, the same row `limit_entry(signal=...)` reads its level at, so there is
no look-ahead: the distance is known before the fill happens.

**It is frozen for the life of the trade.** The level is computed once, from
the price the entry actually filled at (slippage included, exactly as `pct`
does it), and the trade keeps it until it closes. A trailing stop freezes its
trail *distance* the same way and then ratchets normally on the bar high (or
the close, with `use_high=False`). A distance that kept moving during the trade
would be a different order, not this one.

**A distance the series cannot give arms nothing, loudly.** If the series holds
NaN, zero or a negative number on the signal bar, no bracket is armed on that
trade at all, `result.brackets_not_armed` counts it, and `result.warnings`
names the order. A position you believe is protected and is not is the worst
failure this family has, so the engine refuses to invent a level.

```python
result = mbt.run(strategy, config, store)
print(result.brackets_not_armed)   # 0 when every trade got its bracket
```

A warm-up is the usual cause: `atr(14)` is NaN for its first 13 bars. Set
`warmup_bars` on the config, or gate the sizing on the indicator being ready.

A `param()` inside the series makes the distance sweepable like any other
expression, with nothing else to declare.

### Cost of a signal distance

A `signal=` distance is read per trade, which the fast kernels do not do: a
strategy that uses one runs on the general loop, and a sweep over it stays on
the CPU. `run_sweep` is always on the CPU and says nothing; asking for the GPU
with `run_sweep_lite(device="cuda")` warns with the reason ("an exit order takes
its distance from a signal") and runs on the CPU. A constant `pct` keeps the
fast path and the GPU.

## Entry Orders

By default an entry takes a market fill on the execution bar (see
[Execution Model](#execution-model)). Four order types let the entry rest at a
price instead:

| Builder method | Fills when | Fill price | Costs |
|---|---|---|---|
| `.limit_entry(...)` | price comes **to** the level | the level exactly | maker, no slippage |
| `.stop_entry(...)` | price breaks **through** the level | the level, or the open if the bar gapped through it | taker + slippage |
| `.market_if_touched(...)` | price comes **to** the level | the level | taker + slippage |
| `.stop_limit_entry(...)` | breaks through `stop`, then rests at `limit` | the limit | maker, no slippage |

### Where the level comes from

Every method takes exactly one of three price forms:

```python
.limit_entry(offset_bps=25)          # 25 bps below the signal close (above, for a sell)
.limit_entry(price=60_000)           # a fixed level
.limit_entry(signal="entry_px")      # a level this strategy computes
```

`signal=` is the general form: name any signal the strategy defines and the
order rests on that series, read on the signal bar.

```python
from manifoldbt.indicators import atr, close, ema

trend = ema(close, 50)
entry_px = close - atr(14)          # rest one ATR below the close

strategy = (
    mbt.Strategy.create("pullback_entry")
    .signal("trend", trend)
    .signal("entry_px", entry_px)   # named so the order can reference it
    .size(mbt.when(close > trend, 1.0, 0.0))
    .limit_entry(signal="entry_px", time_in_force={"GTB": 5})
    .stop_loss(pct=3.0)
)
```

### Time in force

`"GTC"` (default, rests until filled or the signal changes), `{"GTB": n}`
(cancel after n bars), `"IOC"` (fill on the arrival bar or cancel).

**An entry order that expires unfilled is posted again on the next bar, at that
bar's level, for as long as the target holds and still differs from the position
you hold.** A target is a desired position, not a one-off event, so expiry is how
you requote: `{"GTB": 1}` on a target that never moves places a fresh order every
bar, each at the level that bar computes. Nothing changes for an order that
filled, nor for one cancelled because the target itself moved.

### Three things to watch

**A resting order keeps the level it was created with.** `signal=` is read once,
on the bar the order is placed, and held until the order fills, expires or is
cancelled. It does **not** follow the series afterwards. A time-limited order
does move, but in steps: it holds its level until it expires, and the order that
replaces it reads the series again (see [Time in force](#time-in-force)). That is the intended
behaviour of a resting order, and it is the trap for a band strategy: if the
band moves every bar, the order waits at a price the band has left, and a bar
that gaps past the stale level still fills there. Watch the out-of-range fill
warnings, which count exactly this.

If what you want is "fill wherever my level is on the bar that trades", that is
not a resting order at all: use
[`ExecutionPrice.custom`](#filling-at-a-computed-level), which re-reads the
level every bar. Keep a resting entry for what it models, a real order sitting
in the book at a price you chose.

**A resting entry can simply never fill.** A strategy whose entries never
trigger produces a flat equity curve with no drawdown, which reads as a clean
backtest. The engine counts unfilled entries and reports them:

```python
result = mbt.run(strategy, config, store)
for w in result.warnings:
    print(w)   # "N entry order(s) expired unfilled and M were still resting ..."
```

**Sizing uses the close, not the level.** In `FractionOfEquity` mode a target of
`1.0` is converted to units at the signal-bar close, so an entry resting 2% away
buys ~2% too much notional. `size_at_fill_price=True` sizes off the order's own
level instead. It is off by default because turning it on changes the results of
strategies written against the old behaviour.

### Cost

A conditional entry runs on the general simulation loop rather than the fast
kernel, so parameter sweeps over one are slower than sweeps over a market entry
and cannot use the GPU. `run_sweep` reports which setting took you off the fast
path.

This is specific to a **resting order**, which can stay unfilled across bars.
Filling at a computed level does not carry that cost: see
[Filling at a computed level](#filling-at-a-computed-level), which stays on the
fast kernel and on the GPU.

## Cross-Asset References

Use `mbt.symbol_ref()` to reference another symbol's data in multi-asset strategies:

```python
pair_close = mbt.symbol_ref("ETHUSDT", "close")
ratio = close / (pair_close + mbt.lit(1e-12))
```

> **Important:** Expressions using `symbol_ref()` must be registered as named signals (`.signal("name", expr)`), not passed directly to `.size()`. The multi-pass evaluator needs named signals to route cross-asset data correctly.

```python
# Required: symbol_names mapping
config = mbt.BacktestConfig(
    universe=[1, 2, 5],
    symbol_names={"BTCUSDT": 1, "ETHUSDT": 2, "BNBUSDT": 5},
    ...
)
```

---

## Dataset Auto-Resolution

The engine automatically selects the best dataset based on `bar_interval`:

| bar_interval     | Dataset loaded  | Bars (5 years) |
|------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1 min            | `bars_1m`       | ~2.6M          |
| 15 min           | `bars_15m`      | ~175k          |
| 1h - 23h         | `bars_1h`       | ~44k           |
| >= 24h           | `bars_1d`       | ~1.8k          |

When `bar_interval` doesn't exactly match a dataset (e.g. `4h`), the engine loads the closest smaller dataset (`bars_1h`) and pre-resamples to `4h` before simulation.

Override with `accuracy=True` to always load `bars_1m` (precise SL/TP fills).

Override manually with `dataset=`:
```python
store = mbt.DataStore(data_root="data", metadata_db="...", dataset="bars_1m")
```

---

## Diagnostics

```python
# Look-ahead bias detection: a static walk for lead(), then two re-runs
# over shorter windows. The re-runs cannot see a fixed read-ahead
# (close.lead(1) trades the same in every window); the static walk names it.
lookahead = mbt.diagnostics.detect_lookahead(strategy, config, store)
print(lookahead)  # PASS or FAIL with details

# Exposure stability (position consistency across time windows)
stability = mbt.diagnostics.check_exposure_stability(strategy, config, store)

# Post-run risk check
result = mbt.run(strategy, config, store)
risk = mbt.diagnostics.risk_check(result)
```

---

## Profiling

Every result includes microsecond-precision timing:

```python
result = mbt.run(strategy, config, store)
print(result.profile)
# {'data_load_us': 45000, 'align_us': 1000, 'signal_eval_us': 28000,
#  'runtime_prep_us': 500, 'simulation_us': 16000, 'output_build_us': 8000,
#  'total_us': 110000}

print(result.profile_summary())
# Profile (total: 110.0ms)
# ----------------------------------------
#   Data loading      45.0ms   40.9%  ################
#   Signal eval       28.0ms   25.5%  ##########
#   Simulation        16.0ms   14.5%  #####
#   ...
```

[Windows in time](#windows-in-time).

### Signal state

Pine-style helpers. The first four take a **condition**, not a numeric series.

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `bars_since(cond)` | Bars since `cond` was last true; NaN until it first is |
| `streak(cond)` | Length of the current consecutive run of true |
| `count_over(cond, w)` | Count of true rows in the trailing window |
| `time_since(cond)` | **Seconds** since `cond` was last true; NaN until it first is |
| `value_when(cond, source)` | `source` on the last bar where `cond` was true |
| `expr.ffill()` (method) | Last non-NaN value of `expr`, carried forward; NaN until the first one |
| `rising(source, n)` | 1.0 if strictly increasing on each of the last `n` steps |
| `falling(source, n)` | 1.0 if strictly decreasing |
| `pivot_high(source, left, right)` | Causal pivot high — **no lookahead** |
| `pivot_low(source, left, right)` | Causal pivot low |

A pivot only appears on its **confirmation bar**, `right` bars after the pivot
itself. That lag is what makes the signal tradable: a pivot detector that
reports on the pivot bar has read the future.

`ffill()` is a method on an expression, not a `condition -> series` helper, so it
reads its receiver as a series. It is the readable spelling of a persistent armed
state, and unlike `mbt.hold()` it composes with a regime filter -- see
[`mbt.hold()` holds the POSITION, not the value](#mbthold-holds-the-position-not-the-value).

### Cross-sectional (multi-asset)

These read the whole universe at one timestamp, so their argument must be a
column or a named signal — not a sub-expression. Define the sub-expression as
its own signal first.

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `source.cs_mean()` | Cross-sectional mean, broadcast to every symbol |
| `source.cs_rank()` | Cross-sectional fractional rank [0-1] |
| `cs_zscore(source)` | `(v - mean) / std` across symbols, population std |
| `cs_demean(source)` | `v - mean` per timestamp |
| `cs_std(source)` | Cross-sectional population std, broadcast |
| `cs_scale(source)` | L1 (unit-gross) scaling: `v / sum(abs(v))` |
| `cs_winsorize(source, k)` | Clip to `[mean - k*std, mean + k*std]` |
| `cs_quantile(source, q)` | Cross-sectional q-quantile, broadcast |
| `cs_neutralize(source, factor)` | OLS residual of `source` on `factor` |

### Time

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `source.lag(n)` | Value n bars ago |
| `source.lead(n)` | Value n bars ahead. **Future data**: in a strategy this is look-ahead by construction, and `detect_lookahead` fails it by name |
| `source.diff(n)` | Difference over n bars |
| `source.pct_change(n)` | Percentage change over n bars |
| `source.rolling_mean(w)` | Rolling mean |
| `source.rolling_std(w)` | Rolling standard deviation |
| `source.cumsum()` | Cumulative sum |
| `hour()`, `minute()` | Clock components (UTC) |
| `day_of_week()` | 0 = Monday … 6 = Sunday |
| `month()`, `day_of_month()` | Calendar components |
| `year()` | Full year, e.g. 2024 |
| `week_of_year()` | ISO-8601 week [1-53] |
| `day_of_year()` | Ordinal day [1-366] |
| `is_month_start()`, `is_month_end()` | 1.0 / 0.0 |
| `is_quarter_end()` | 1.0 on the last day of Mar/Jun/Sep/Dec |
| `is_weekend()` | 1.0 on Saturday or Sunday |

ISO weeks belong to the year of their Thursday, so `week_of_year()` on 1 January
can read 52 or 53 — that is the definition, not a bug.

### TA-Lib compatibility

Bit-exact against TA-Lib 0.7.1, pinned by a stored fixture of 522 bars.

| Family | Functions |
|--------|-----------|
| Math transform | `sin` `cos` `tan` `asin` `acos` `atan` `sinh` `cosh` `log10` |
| Price transform | `median_price()` `typical_price()` `weighted_close()` `average_price()` |
| Pattern recognition | 38 `cdl_*` functions (see below) |

Every `cdl_*` returns one of `{-100, -80, 0, 80, 100}`: the sign is the
direction, the magnitude is TA-Lib's confidence, and **warmup bars are 0, not
NaN** — a detector's `0` already means "no pattern here".

## Best Practices

1. **Set `signal_delay` deliberately.** It defaults to `0` (fill at the signal bar's close). Raise it to `1` when one bar is a realistic decision-to-fill latency, i.e. on fine-grained bars.
2. **Set `warmup_bars`** to at least the longest indicator period.
3. **Use `mbt.when()` for sizing.** Keep signal logic readable and composable.
4. **Run diagnostics** (`detect_lookahead`, `check_exposure_stability`) on new strategies.
5. **Start with `bar_interval=hours(12)` or `days(1)`** for fast iteration, then refine with smaller intervals.
6. **Use `accuracy=True`** only for final validation with SL/TP — it's 60x slower.
7. **Sweep with `run_sweep_lite`** for large grids. Use `run_sweep` only when you need full Result objects.
