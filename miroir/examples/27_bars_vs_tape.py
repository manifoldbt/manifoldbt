"""Bars and tape - the exit a candle has to guess, and the trades that settle it.

A bracket puts two levels around a position. When one bar's range covers both,
the OHLC cannot say which one traded first: high and low carry no order. The
engine has to assume, and it assumes the stop, because that is the conservative
reading. Assuming is not knowing, and this file measures the gap.

`fill_resolution="ticks"` removes the assumption. Level orders - stop-loss,
take-profit, trailing stop, limit and stop entries - are then resolved against
the individual trades inside each bar, in time order: the level the market
actually printed first is the one that fills, and a stop that gaps fills at the
trade that crossed it. Market orders are unchanged.

Two runs, one per resolution. Same store, same strategy, same bars; the only
difference is the config field. What separates them is the phantom return, the
part of the bar run's result that the trades themselves never gave.

`result.tape_resolution` says how much of the run the tape actually decided:

    bars_on_tape           bars whose level orders were resolved on trades
    bars_fallen_back       bars with no trade in their window (bar rule used)
    contested_bars         bars where the bar rule saw BOTH levels at once
    contested_tp_first     of those, the tape found the take-profit first
    contested_stop_first   of those, the tape found the stop or trailing first
    entries_on_tape        entry orders triggered on a trade

It is `None` in bar mode, which the file prints too: that is how you tell a run
that read the tape from one that could not.

Demonstrates:
  - `fill_resolution="ticks"`: level orders resolved on the bar's own trades
  - `result.tape_resolution`: what the tape decided, and what fell back
  - the return a bar backtest books on the bars it had to guess at

NEEDS THE RESEARCHER PLAN. Reading a stored tape is a Researcher feature; a
Pro licence does not unlock it. Without it the file exits with the refusal
message rather than a traceback; nothing in it is a placeholder.

The strategy is a device, not a claim: fees are zeroed and the bracket is a few
basis points wide, which is what makes single bars cover both levels often
enough to be countable. Read the SIGN of the gap, not its size.

Data: self-contained (network) - one UTC day of a symbol's trades from a public
venue archive, fetched once into `data/tape/`, plus the 1-minute bars rebuilt
from that same tape. The bars ARE the trades, summarised, so the two series
cannot disagree. Real prices: the figures move with the day and the venue.
